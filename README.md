Combarama

Welcome to Combarama, a project designed to demonstrate and strengthen C++ skills and combat gameplay/system programming expertise. This repository showcases a passion for game development through a focus on combat mechanics, AI programming, and player interactions in a simple yet challenging top-down game created with C++ and SDL3.
Project Overview

Combarama is a top-down combat game where the player must clear procedurally generated rooms filled with enemies to progress. It emphasizes dynamic combat, AI behavior, and player abilities, combining these elements to create a fast-paced and engaging experience. This project employs primitives for visual representation, highlighting functionality over aesthetics while focusing on gameplay features.
Key Features:

  Player vs. AI Combat: Engage in strategic battles with different enemy classes and behaviors.
  Abilities and Targeting: Use unique abilities to adapt to various combat scenarios.
  Level Progression: Fight through randomly generated levels to reach the end.
  Expandable Gameplay Systems: Designed to evolve with features like navigation, combat variety, and visual cues.


  Combarama is a work-in-progress, aiming to refine technical and creative skills while fostering an understanding of combat mechanics, AI programming, and gameplay design. Constructive feedback and contributions are welcome!
